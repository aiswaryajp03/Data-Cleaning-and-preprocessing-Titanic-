This project uses Machine Learning to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. It demonstrates:

-> Data cleaning (handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns),

-> Feature engineering (one‑hot encoding of categorical columns),

-> Feature scaling (using Min‑Max Scaler),

-> Model training (Logistic Regression),

-> Model evaluation (accuracy)
